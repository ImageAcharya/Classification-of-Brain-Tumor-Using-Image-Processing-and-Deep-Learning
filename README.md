# Classification-of-Brain-Tumor-Using-Image-Processing-and-Deep-Learning

Automated disease detection in medical imaging has become an emergent field in several medical diagnostic applications. Automated detection of tumors in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is crucial as it provides essential information about abnormal tissues necessary for planning treatment. The conventional method for defect detection in magnetic resonance brain images is human inspection.

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a brain tumor classification system that leverages image processing and deep learning techniques. The objective is to accurately identify and classify different types of brain tumors, including glioma tumors, meningioma tumors, and pituitary tumors, as well as identifying images with no tumors based on medical imaging data, such as MRI scan
By utilizing advanced algorithms and neural networks, the proposed system enhances the efficiency and accuracy of tumor classification, enabling timely and precise diagnoses. Comparative analysis was conducted among various pre-trained deep learning models, including VGG16, ResNet, and ViT, to select the final model for brain tumor classification. As a result, VGG16 was chosen.

## Objectives 

- To leverage image processing and deep learning techniques to enhance the 
accuracy and efficiency of brain tumor classification from MRI images.
- To evaluate and compare the performance of various deep learning 
architectures and algorithms for classification of brain tumors.

## Applications
The project report on the classification of brain tumors using image processing and deep 
learning from MRI images has several valuable applications. The findings can be utilized 
to develop a clinical decision support system, aiding healthcare professionals in accurate 
diagnosis and treatment planning for brain tumors. This, in turn, can improve patient care, 
enhance outcomes, and optimize healthcare management. Moreover, the project report can 
serve as an educational resource, providing insights and methodologies for students, 
researchers, and practitioners interested in medical imaging and deep learning applications 
in healthcare.

## Dataset

The project includes the construction of a dataset of brain tumor images, as well as preprocessing methods to enhance image quality. The dataset will be made available for further research and development.

## Scope and Limitations of Project

This project combines image processing techniques and deep learning models for brain 
tumor classification. The project involves analyzing MRI scans to accurately classify 
different types of brain tumors. Image processing techniques is utilized for preprocessing, 
while deep learning models are trained and fine-tuned for classification task. The developed 
model is deployed on a web environment, allowing for user-friendly access and interaction.

While the integration of image processing and deep learning techniques offers potential 
benefits, there are several limitations to consider. The effectiveness of the approach depends
on the availability of a suitable dataset for training and evaluation, as well as the 
computational resources required for deep learning model training. Challenges related to 
variability and interpretation of medical imaging may impact the accuracy and 
generalizability of the developed models. Deployment on a web environment requires
careful consideration of scalability, performance, and security aspects. Additionally, further 
clinical validation is necessary to assess the real-world performance and adoption of the 
developed system. 

## Future Enhancement

Some straightforward improvements that can be made to enhance this project further:
➢ Increased Dataset Size: Expanding the dataset with more MRI images of brain tumors 
from diverse sources can enhance the model's accuracy and ability to generalize.
➢ Mobile Compatibility: Developing a mobile application version of the system to make 
it accessible and convenient for healthcare providers.
➢ Localization: Adding support for multiple languages and region-specific adaptations to 
make the tool usable in various healthcare settings globally.
➢ Performance Optimization: Continuously optimizing the deep learning models and 
image processing techniques for faster and more efficient classification.
➢ Telemedicine Integration: Facilitating telemedicine by allowing remote healthcare 
professionals to access and use the system for diagnosis and consultations.
➢ User Feedback Mechanism: Implementing a user feedback system to gather input 
from healthcare providers for ongoing improvements and feature additions.
